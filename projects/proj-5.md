**作品简介:**
<br>

此作创作于2024年。当时我想找一篇篇幅较长且情感充沛的诗作，用以练习灵飞经风格的小楷。灵飞经以其轻盈、飘逸的特点著称，而李商隐的《锦瑟》词句优美、意境朦胧，文字本身的紧凑感与灵飞经这种“轻飘飘”的字体风格非常契合。通过这种尝试，我希望在工整的楷书间表达出诗词中那份绵密而细腻的情感。

基本信息：



内容：李商隐《锦瑟》

年份：2024

书体：楷书（灵飞经风格）

格式：八开小斗方（框架装裱）

**Description:**

Created in 2024, I was looking for a relatively long and emotionally rich poem to practice the Lingfeijing style of small Standard Script. Known for its light and ethereal touch, this style required a text that could complement its delicate nature. Li Shangyin’s "The Patterned Lute," with its beautiful imagery and melancholic depth, proved to be the perfect fit. The goal was to align the dense arrangement of characters with a graceful, "floating" calligraphic style.
