我自八岁起开始学习书法，在翰墨林书画阁师从蔡伟键老师（世界最年轻书法老师）。这个开始造就了如今对于书法虚怀若谷的我。目前我专注于书法创作，同时也开始尝试教学。

学习书法是我的乐趣，我热爱探索各种书体以及碑帖其中的奥妙之处，并将它们的特点融会贯通，去创造独一无二的作品。在学习书法的路途中，我逐渐理解每一幅书法作品背后，都凝聚着提笔之人倾尽的心血、表达的情感，以及这幅作品诞生的独特意义。

对我而言，书法不止是我的兴趣爱好，它也是让我的人生变得精彩的关键。



I started learning calligraphy at the age of eight at Calle Chain Art Centre, studying under Mr. Chai Wee Kian (recognized as the world's youngest calligraphy teacher). This foundation has shaped my humble dedication to the art. Today, I focus on creating calligraphy works while also beginning to share my knowledge through teaching.

Calligraphy is my passion. I love exploring the mysteries of various scripts and ancient steles, integrating their distinct characteristics to create works that are truly unique. Throughout this journey, I have come to understand that every piece of calligraphy embodies the creator's dedication, emotions, and the significance of the moment it was born.

For me, calligraphy is more than just a hobby; it is the key element that makes my life vibrant and meaningful.
